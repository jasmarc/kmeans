The purpose of this assignment was to implement the K-Means Clustering Algorithm and perform the algorithm on a corpus of 90 documents in order to observe the effects of varied seed documents and varied number of clusters.

\section{Algorithms and Datastructures} % (fold)
\label{sec:algorithms_and_datastructures}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \texttt{\textbf{Coordinate}} - The \texttt{Coordinate} object inherits from Ruby's Array class and adds a few new methods and properties. \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{\texttt{data}} - the payload.
    \item \textbf{\texttt{cluster}} - the \texttt{Cluster} this \texttt{Coordinate} belongs to.
    \item \textbf{\texttt{Coordinate.centroid}} - class-level method that takes a bunch of \texttt{Coordinate}s and computes the centroid of all of them.
    \item \textbf{\texttt{add}} - adds two \texttt{Coordinate}s.
    \item \textbf{\texttt{distance\_to}} - calculates the distance between two \texttt{Coordinate}s.
    \item \textbf{\texttt{norm}} - takes the norm of the \texttt{Coordinate}.
    \item \textbf{\texttt{sphere!}} - destructively spheres the \texttt{Coordinate}.
  \end{itemize}
  \item \textbf{\texttt{Cluster}} - models a cluster, essentially just a big collection of \texttt{Coordinate}s, but with a few extra pieces of functionality. \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{\texttt{elements}} - the elements that belong to this \texttt{Cluster}.
    \item \textbf{\texttt{centroid}} - the centroid of this \texttt{Cluster}.
    \item \textbf{\texttt{distance\_to}} - the distance between the centroid of this \texttt{Cluster} and the given \texttt{Coordinate}.
    \item \textbf{\texttt{recalculate\_centroid}} - recalculates the centroid of the \texttt{Cluster}.
    \item \textbf{\texttt{add}} - adds the given \texttt{Coordinate} to this \texttt{Cluster}.
    \item \textbf{\texttt{remove}} - removes the given \texttt{Coordinate} from this \texttt{Cluster}.
    \item \textbf{\texttt{residual\_sum\_squared}} - computes and returns the residual sum squared of all the \texttt{Coordinate}s in this \texttt{Cluster}.
    \item \textbf{\texttt{title}} - finds the \texttt{Coordinate} closest to the centroid of the cluster and returns its \texttt{.data} property.
  \end{itemize}
  \item \textbf{\texttt{KMeans}} - this is the object that actually performs the kmeans calculations. Simply initialize it with an array of \texttt{Coordinate}s and a k-value and then call \texttt{compute}. You can then print it out and the \texttt{to\_s} method will show each cluster with it residual sum squared value, a ``title'' which is just the closest document to the centroid, and a listing of the documents in the cluster with snippets from the documents.
\end{itemize}

\section{Experiments} % (fold)
\label{sec:experiments}

The first experiment was to run the algorithm on the 90-document corpus with a bisection (i.e. $k = 2$). Seed documents were chosen at random for each run and residual sum of squares was computed for each run of the algorithm. Below are the results of running the algorithm 100 times. Figure 1. shows a histogram of RSS values by frequency. Table 1. shows the statistics for the same run.

    std. dev. &0.7458
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Statistics for Residual Sum of Squares for Bisecting K-Means}
\end{table}

\newpage
The next experiment was to run the K-Means algorithm, varying the value of k. Below, in Figure 2., we see the values of RSS decreasing with increased k-value. There is a noticeable elbow around the value $k = 6$.
\begin{figure}[h!]
  \centering

  \caption{RSS Values of K-Means for Various Values of K}
\end{figure}

Finally, we observe multiple trials (3) for a few select values of k (2, 3, 5, 10 and 15). The major observations from this experiment are that the RSS is decreasing and that the implementation of the algorithm seems stable (the RSS  values for a given k-value do not vary wildly, but are instead tightly-clustered with low standard deviation).

  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Topic Labels for K=3 Clustering}
\end{table}

Despite the elbow in Figure 2., indicating that the ideal value for $k$ is about 6, my own experiment and attempts at labeling the clusters seem to indicate that there are roughly three clusters: biology, space, and internet technology.

I started by computing the document that is closest to the centroids for each cluster in a $k = 6$ clustering. I then visually inspected the representative documents for each cluster and attempted to come up with a keyword or two that would describe each cluster. After attempting this for $k = 6$, I noticed that there appeared to be only 3 clearly distinguishable clusters, so I repeated the experiment with $k = 3$, this time modifying my code to output some snippets of the documents in each cluster to confirm my hypothesis.
